## Configuration

### 2. Image Size Configuration

The image size for most viewed products is defined in the `view.xml` file. You can customize the image size by modifying this file:

```xml
<image id="most_viewed_products_list" type="small_image">
    <width>152</width>
    <height>190</height>
</image>
```

## Usage

Once the module is installed and configured, it will automatically display the most viewed products on the product details page under the **Most Viewed** section. 

The **Most Viewed** products block will be displayed in the sidebar or the content area, depending on the layout you choose.

### Frontend Layout

The block of most viewed products will be added to the product detail page via the `catalog_product_view.xml` layout file. It will be shown in the `content.aside` container.

The product information includes:
- Product image
- Product name with a link to the product page
- Product price
- Add to cart and other action buttons (e.g., add to wishlist, add to compare)

### Example of Display
